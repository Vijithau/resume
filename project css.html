    <h1><mark> NOVEL HIGH CAPACITY DATA HIDDING ALOGORITHM
        USING SALT AND PEPPER NOISE</mark>
        </h1>
        <p><h2>This is merging of two concepts of data hiding and salt and pepper
             noise removing.Here I am using one filter that is BM3D(Block Matching 3 Dimensional Filter).
             We are embedding the data into image.we use the parameters like PSNR(peak sign to noise ratio)
             and SSIM(structural similarity index measure).Here  to get the better image quality by using 
             this BM3D filter.It Reduces the Noise level in the Extracted Image.It mainly used in military 
             and intelligence communication and multimedia security.In this result some images are there gray 
             image,noise image,embedded image,BM3D filtered image.The main function is to give the better
              image with secret data.</h2>
